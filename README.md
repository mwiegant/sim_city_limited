# Sim City Limited

A simple nodejs server which will be able to connect to a mongo database.

Once completed, the code for this server will sit on an Amazon Web Services EC2 Instance along with its required
database.  From there, I will be able to play with a basic simulation I will set up to run on the server.

More details on what the simulation is will come later.
